# CSGO-StrategyPlanner
An android app for creating your own strategies in CS Go

On the mainpage you have a go-button and plusbutton. To start you need to add strategies to be able to read them from the database
via the go-button. You can see the strategies for the map chosen in the mainactivity and to select another map, go back to mainpage
and select a different map.
